        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am a 19 year old man who is <span>full of youthful energy, and disciplines that energy.</span>
             I am a hard worker, I <span>dismiss any and all distraction</span>, and always keep a <span>focus on the task at hand.</span>
             I am not the type to laze around, as I enjoy challenges and push to make myself <span>stronger and wiser every day, I love to learn and grow.</span> 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Most of my hobbies are entombed by a risk and reward aspect. For example, Hiking.
             Accomplishing a hike is always a great feeling, especially when you get to the top of the mountain, and are rewarded with a beautiful view accompanied by inner peace and satisfaction.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>What motivates me?</h3>
        <p>I always get asked as to why i like moving around and hate being lazy. 
            So i ask them, what does watching TV, TikTok and other distractions do to benefit your life?
            The answer is always the same, and that is that they cannot answer the question.
            I believe that to be succesful and to live a fulfulling life, one must improve himself/herself daily, to become the strongest version of of their enabled body possible.
            So, to answer what motivates me, it is the thought of looking back on my life one day and saying i could've done more. 
            I will take any and every oppurtunity to better myself, and fail again and again until it is impossible to fail.
        </p>

            <p>
                I am a skilled musician, ranging from brass instruments such as the tuba and trumpet, to stringed instruments, such as the guitar nd bass guitar, even the cello.
                I also take part in triathlons as i like to keep fit and healthy, and stay competing.
                My skills are always improving, as my recently gained skills in Full-Stack Web Development have been persistently scaling, and will do so until I have gained as much knowledge from the subject as i can.
                I participate in MMA, mainly focusing on kick-boxing, as I believe it is the ultimate man-to-man sport and competition.

                My current course of education is at HyperionDev in the city of Cape Town, where I am being taught the skills needed to be a Full Stack Web Developer.
